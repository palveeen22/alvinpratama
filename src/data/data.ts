        title: 'Stop Using 100vh for Full-Height Layouts on Mobile: Here‚Äôs Why',
        content: `If you're using \`100vh\` for full-height layouts in your CSS, you might be unknowingly creating layout issues ‚Äî especially on mobile devices.

### üö´ The Problem:
\`100vh\` measures the viewport height *without accounting for dynamic browser UI elements*, such as the mobile address or navigation bars. This means your layout may look fine on desktop but:
- Content gets cut off on mobile
- Unwanted scrollbars appear
- Elements don't align correctly

### ‚úÖ The Modern Fix: \`100dvh\`
Instead of hardcoding \`height: 100vh;\`, use:

\`\`\`css
height: 100dvh;
\`\`\`

The new \`dvh\` unit (Dynamic Viewport Height) adapts to visible screen size, **even when browser UI changes** ‚Äî like when the address bar hides on scroll.

### üß† TL;DR
- **Before:** \`height: 100vh;\` ‚Üí breaks layouts on mobile
- **Now:** \`height: 100dvh;\` ‚Üí mobile-safe and reliable

It‚Äôs a tiny change with a big impact that saves hours of layout debugging.`,

        content: `Life is unpredictable, and while we can‚Äôt control every situation, we *can* prepare ourselves with knowledge and mindset that may one day save our lives.

### ü•§ 1. Water First
Your body can only survive about **3 days without water**. In an emergency:
- Always identify clean water sources.
- If unsure, boil or filter water before drinking.
- Avoid seawater ‚Äî it dehydrates faster.

### üçû 2. Food for Energy
You can survive **3 weeks without food**, but energy levels drop quickly.
- Focus on calorie-rich foods: nuts, dried fruits, grains.
- Learn local edible plants if outdoors.
- Avoid unknown berries or mushrooms.

### üß≠ 3. Shelter and Warmth
Exposure can kill faster than hunger.
- Prioritize building shelter from wind, rain, or sun.
- Layer clothing to trap body heat.
- Fire = warmth, water purification, and morale.

### üì± 4. Communication and Signals
- Always carry a whistle, flashlight, or phone power bank.
- SOS (¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑) is internationally recognized.
- Reflective surfaces (mirrors, metal) can signal far away.

### üß† 5. Mindset is Everything
Panic is the biggest enemy.
- Breathe deeply, slow your heart rate.
- Break big problems into small tasks.
- Stay positive ‚Äî many survival stories come down to mental strength.

### üß† TL;DR
- **Water first** (3 days rule)
- **Food second** (3 weeks rule)
- **Shelter** protects from exposure
- **Signal** to get rescued
- **Mindset** keeps you alive

### ‚è∞ 1. Procrastinate Strategically
Let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî you‚Äôre going to procrastinate anyway. The trick is *controlled procrastination*.  
- Do small easy tasks first (so you feel productive).  
- Pretend you‚Äôre ‚Äúresearching‚Äù while actually scrolling memes.  
- When panic hits, your brain magically unlocks *superhuman focus mode*.  

### ‚òï 2. Coffee = Cheat Code
Caffeine is basically a productivity potion.  
- 1 cup = ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start soon.‚Äù  
- 2 cups = ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the zone.‚Äù  
- 3 cups = ‚ÄúI can see through time.‚Äù  

### üéµ 3. The Right Music

- Movie soundtracks ‚Üí feel like a hero.  
- EDM ‚Üí type like a hacker.  
- Random Lo-Fi ‚Üí at least you‚Äôll cry in rhythm.  

### üìã 4. The 80/20 Rule
Remember: 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort.  
Translation: Write the important parts first, and fill the fluff later.  
Professors, bosses, and clients usually won‚Äôt notice‚Ä¶ unless your fluff is just ‚Äúlorem ipsum.‚Äù  

### üõèÔ∏è 5. Accept Imperfection
Perfectionists miss deadlines. Survivors submit ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù and fix later.  
At 11:59 PM, ugly but done > beautiful but late.  

### üß† TL;DR
- Procrastinate (but make it look intentional)  
- Fuel yourself with coffee and music  
- Do the 20% that matters  
- Hit send before midnight  

Finishing before the deadline isn‚Äôt about being perfect.

    title: 'Riding Through SonQuli: My Horseback Adventure in Kyrgyzstan',
content: `Traveling is best experienced with a little adventure, and nothing beats riding a horse through the breathtaking landscapes of SonQuli, Kyrgyzstan. What started as a spontaneous decision turned into one of the most transformative journeys of my life. Here's the story of my unforgettable adventure in the heart of Central Asia.

## üó∫Ô∏è The Journey Begins: Landing in Bishkek

I arrived in Kyrgyzstan with minimal expectations and maximum curiosity. My plane touched down at Manas International Airport in Bishkek early in the morning, the sun just beginning to paint the Tian Shan mountains in shades of pink and gold. The air coming through the airport doors was crisp and clean, noticeably different from the cities I'd left behind.

### Meeting Zamiraet

At the arrivals area, a stocky man with a warm smile and an unexpectedly firm handshake greeted me. "Welcome to Kyrgyzstan! I am Zamiraet," he said in accented but clear English. What I didn't know then ‚Äî what he casually mentioned only hours later ‚Äî was that Zamiraet was actually the chief of police in the region. 

"Today, I'm not police chief," he laughed when he saw my surprised expression. "Today, I am your guide, your friend, and your protector in my country." His eyes crinkled with genuine warmth. This dual identity ‚Äî authority figure and gracious host ‚Äî perfectly embodied the Kyrgyz spirit I would come to understand over the next three days.

### An Unexpected Invitation

Instead of heading straight to a hotel as I'd expected, Zamiraet had other plans. "First, you come to my home. My wife has been cooking since 5 AM. She will be very angry with me if I bring you to hotel on empty stomach." He said this with mock seriousness, but I could tell the invitation was genuinely important to him.

We drove through Bishkek's wide, Soviet-era boulevards lined with poplars, past colorful bazaars already bustling with activity, and into a residential neighborhood where the city began to blend with mountain foothills. His home was modest but welcoming, with a well-tended garden where his wife was cutting fresh herbs.

His wife, a kind-faced woman, immediately hugged me like I was a relative she hadn't seen in years. Despite my limited Russian and her warm gestures, she communicated volumes through her expressions, pulling me into her kitchen where an incredible spread awaited.

### A Feast of Welcome

The dining table was covered with a white cloth and laden with dishes I'd never seen before ‚Äî all featuring horse meat, which is central to Kyrgyz cuisine:

- **Plov** ‚Äî fragrant rice pilaf with horse meat, carrots, and spices that had been slow-cooking since dawn. She served me a heaping portion, watching my face intently for my reaction. When I closed my eyes in appreciation at the first bite, she clapped her hands and beamed.

- **Boiled potatoes with horse meat** ‚Äî simple but incredibly flavorful, the meat tender and rich. It was my first time tasting horse meat, and I was surprised by how savory and delicious it was.

- **Strong black tea** served in traditional piala bowls, offered continuously throughout the meal as is customary in Kyrgyz hospitality.

"In Kyrgyzstan, we say: guest is gift from God," Zamiraet explained in Russian as his wife continued piling food on my plate. I responded in my broken Russian, and we managed to communicate through a mix of Russian phrases and gestures. "To feed guest is honor, not burden. You eat, you become family."

I was overwhelmed ‚Äî not just by the quantity of food, but by the genuine warmth. Here I was, a stranger who had landed in their country just hours ago, being treated like a cherished family member. She wouldn't let me leave the table until I'd tried everything at least twice. When I finally leaned back, completely full, both of them laughed at my satisfied but slightly pained expression.

### The Three-Day Journey Begins

After the meal, over yet another cup of tea (I would learn that in Kyrgyzstan, there's always time for tea), Zamiraet laid out a hand-drawn map on the table. 

"Three days," he said, tracing a route with his finger. "First, we go to Ala-Archa National Park ‚Äî you see real Kyrgyz mountains close to Bishkek. Second day, we drive to Issyk-Kul Lake, stop at Burana Tower, meet some nomad families. Third day ‚Äî this is special ‚Äî we go to SonQuli. Not many tourists go there. Very beautiful, very real Kyrgyzstan."

What struck me was how he'd planned this not as a typical tour, but as a journey to show me his country through his eyes. Being a police chief, he knew the region intimately ‚Äî every road, every village, who to trust, where to find the best experiences. But more than that, he genuinely wanted me to understand and love his homeland.

"I take vacation for three days," he smiled. "My deputy is in charge. He is happy ‚Äî means he can sit and drink tea all day instead of working." He winked. "But don't worry. I tell all police stations on our route: my friend is traveling. Everyone will help if you need."

I hadn't expected such dedication from someone I'd just met. "Why are you doing all this?" I asked, genuinely curious.

Zamiraet's expression turned serious for a moment. "You know, when I was young, I travel to many countries. People were sometimes... not kind to foreigner from Kyrgyzstan. They have wrong ideas about us, about Central Asia. I promise myself: if foreigners come to my country, I show them real Kyrgyz hospitality. I show them we are good people, proud people, with beautiful land and big hearts."

He paused, then smiled again. "Also, I am police chief. Is boring sometimes. Three days adventure is good for soul!"

### Setting Off

The next morning, Zamiraet picked me up in his sturdy 4x4 ‚Äî essential for Kyrgyzstan's mountain roads, he explained. The back was packed with camping gear, extra clothes, food supplies, and a large thermos of tea that his wife had prepared.

"My wife says you are too thin," he laughed in Russian, handing me a bag of snacks for the road. "She makes me promise to feed you every three hours."

As we drove out of Bishkek, the city giving way to dramatic mountain landscapes, Zamiraet began pointing out landmarks and sharing stories. We communicated in Russian ‚Äî my skills were basic but enough to understand his passionate descriptions of his homeland. He also asked questions about my life, my country, my family. He was genuinely curious about the world beyond his borders, creating a true cultural exchange rather than a one-sided tour.

"You know what is best thing about being guide?" he asked as we climbed into the mountains. "I see my country new again through visitor's eyes. You remind me how lucky I am to live here."

Little did I know that this chance encounter with a police chief turned guide would become one of the most meaningful friendships of my life, and that the next three days would completely transform how I understood hospitality, adventure, and human connection.

Zamiraet wasn't just showing me Kyrgyzstan ‚Äî he was inviting me into his life, his culture, and his heart. And it all started with that unexpected feast in his home, prepared by his wife's loving hands.

### üêé 1. Horseback Through Mountains

There's something profoundly magical about the wind in your hair as your horse climbs steep mountain trails, each hoofbeat echoing against ancient rocks. My horse, a sturdy chestnut mare named Aizada (which means "moon-like" in Kyrgyz), became my companion and teacher over the following days.

**The Experience:**
- The horses here are not just sturdy ‚Äî they're mountain athletes, bred for generations to navigate treacherous terrain with grace and confidence. Aizada seemed to know every rock and root on the path.
- Our guides don't just lead; they're storytellers, historians, and philosophers. Nurlan shared tales of Manas, the legendary Kyrgyz hero, as we rode. He pointed out ancient petroglyphs carved into boulders, some dating back 3,000 years. Zamiraet added context from his perspective: "As police chief, I protect these ancient stones from thieves who want to sell to museums abroad. They belong here, in mountains, where ancestors put them."
- Every turn revealed a new vista more stunning than the last. One moment, you're riding through dense juniper forests where sunlight filters through in golden streams. The next, you emerge onto a high plateau where the world stretches endlessly in all directions. Zamiraet would occasionally stop the group, pull out his phone, and make calls to check on various situations back in town ‚Äî a surreal reminder that this adventure guide was also running a police department remotely.

**What I Learned:**
Riding in these mountains taught me patience and trust. There were moments on narrow cliff paths where I had to completely surrender control to Aizada. She knew the way; I just had to trust her. It's a metaphor for life that stuck with me long after the journey ended.

Zamiraet rode beside me during one particularly nerve-wracking section, where the path was barely wider than a horse and dropped away sharply on one side. "You know why I bring you here?" he asked calmly in Russian. "Because you trust me. And now you learn to trust horse, trust path, trust yourself. This is Kyrgyz way ‚Äî we survive centuries in these mountains by trusting."

The physical challenge was real ‚Äî my legs ached, and I discovered muscles I didn't know existed. But each moment brought new energy and the anticipation of what lay ahead. By the end of our ride, I could mount Aizada more confidently, and we moved as one unit through the landscape. Zamiraet nodded approvingly: "Good. Now you are becoming little bit Kyrgyz."

### üåÑ 2. Spectacular Views That Steal Your Breath

SonQuli is a land of dramatic contrasts: jagged peaks that pierce the sky, gentle valleys carpeted in wildflowers, and crystal-clear lakes that seem to have been placed there by divine hands. Words and even photographs struggle to capture the sheer magnitude of beauty here.

**The Landscapes:**
- Mountains painted in layers of green and gold during summer, with snow-capped peaks providing a striking white contrast. The play of light throughout the day transforms the entire scene ‚Äî morning light casts everything in soft pastels, midday brings crisp definition, and sunset sets the mountains ablaze in oranges and purples.
- The lakes ‚Äî oh, the lakes! SonQuli Lake itself is a massive alpine wonder at 3,016 meters above sea level. Its waters are so clear you can see fish swimming 10 meters down. Smaller lakes dot the landscape like sapphires scattered by giants. Each one reflects the sky like a perfect mirror, creating moments where you can't tell where earth ends and heaven begins.
- Sunsets that feel almost unreal, like someone turned up the saturation on reality itself. I watched one sunset where the clouds caught fire in shades of crimson and gold, reflected perfectly in the lake below, creating a 360-degree display of color that brought tears to my eyes.

**Memorable Moments:**
One afternoon, we crested a ridge, and suddenly the entire valley opened before us. Nurlan stopped his horse and simply pointed. No words. Just silence and beauty. We sat there for twenty minutes, watching clouds cast moving shadows across the valley floor below, like a living painting that never repeated itself.

Another day, we encountered a herd of wild Marco Polo sheep on a distant cliff. Through binoculars, I watched these magnificent creatures navigate terrain that would terrify most humans. They moved with casual grace across near-vertical faces, reminding me that we were visitors in their ancient home.

### üèïÔ∏è 3. Camping Under the Stars

After long days of riding, nothing beats the profound peace of resting under the Kyrgyz sky. Our camps were simple ‚Äî traditional yurts and sometimes just sleeping bags under the open sky ‚Äî but they offered something no five-star hotel ever could: genuine connection with nature.

**The Night Experience:**
- Stars so bright and numerous they almost feel close enough to touch. Away from any light pollution, the Milky Way stretches across the sky like a cosmic river. I saw shooting stars almost every night. Nurlan taught me to identify constellations as the ancient Kyrgyz shepherds knew them ‚Äî different stories, same stars. Zamiraet, lying on his back beside the fire, shared a different perspective: "You know, as police chief, I see too much darkness in people sometimes. But here, under these stars, I remember people are small and universe is big. Makes problems seem small too."
- The soundscape of night in the mountains is its own symphony: the gentle sound of a nearby river provides constant white noise, making sleep effortless. Horses softly munching grass. The occasional call of an eagle owl. Wind whispering through juniper branches. It's nature's lullaby.
- Local shepherds sometimes joined our camps, appearing out of the dusk with their flocks. They brought fresh yogurt, dried fruits, and stories. One elderly shepherd named Taalai had never left these mountains in his 73 years. When he learned Zamiraet was the police chief, he laughed: "Ah! The boy who used to steal apples from my tree is now big boss!" Zamiraet had the grace to look embarrassed while everyone laughed. "I was eight years old!" he protested, but clearly the shepherd's memory was long.

**The Community:**
What struck me most was the sense of community and sharing. Despite having very little in material terms, everyone offered what they had freely. One night, a family of nomads invited us into their yurt during an unexpected rainstorm. We sat on thick felt carpets while rain drummed on the roof, sharing bread and laughter.

Zamiraet's presence as police chief created interesting dynamics. People clearly respected him, but not in a fearful way ‚Äî more like a trusted community leader who happened to have authority. "You see," he explained to me later, "in villages and mountains, police chief is not just enforcer. I am also mediator, protector, sometimes counselor. These people are not criminals to watch ‚Äî they are neighbors to help."

A young shepherd named Bakyt approached Zamiraet that evening with a problem about stolen livestock. Rather than telling him to file an official report, Zamiraet listened carefully, asked questions, and promised to look into it when he returned. "This is real police work," he said to me. "Not just arresting people. Solving problems, keeping peace, protecting community."

Their 5-year-old daughter sang a traditional song for us, her voice pure and unselfconscious. When she finished, Zamiraet's eyes were suspiciously bright. "My daughter, same age," he said quietly. "She is with her mother now in Bishkek. I miss her, but I want to share my country with you. Family understands."

I learned to appreciate simple comforts I'd always taken for granted: warm tea after cold riding, dry socks, a safe place to sleep. Luxury, I realized, isn't about thread count or amenities. It's about feeling genuinely welcomed and safe, about sharing authentic moments with people who open their lives to you.

### üç≤ 4. Taste of Local Life

Immersing in local culture added flavor to adventure in ways I never anticipated. Food became a gateway to understanding a completely different way of life.

**The Culinary Journey:**
- Freshly baked bread (non) pulled straight from a clay tandoor oven, its crust still crackling with heat. Paired with yak milk tea (sut-chai) that's salty, creamy, and surprisingly addictive once you adjust to it. The first sip was shocking; by day three, I craved it every morning.
- Beshbarmak, the national dish, means "five fingers" because traditionally you eat it with your hands. It's horse meat (yes, really) with flat noodles and onions, served in a ceremony that turns a meal into a cultural lesson. The eldest person receives choice cuts, and there's a specific order to everything. It tastes rich and gamey, completely unlike anything I'd had before.
- Kuurdak, a hearty stew of meat and potatoes cooked in a kazan (large wok) over an open fire. Watching a shepherd prepare this while telling stories, the smell of meat and smoke mixing in the mountain air, became one of my favorite memories.
- Fresh honey collected from wild mountain bees, so thick and flavorful it barely resembled the supermarket version back home. Drizzled over fresh bread with butter ‚Äî absolute perfection.

**Cultural Immersion:**
- Chatting with villagers about their traditions through my broken Russian, which they patiently helped me improve. We discussed everything from marriage customs to why they still practice semi-nomadic herding despite modernization pressing in from all sides.
- Experiencing Kyrgyz hospitality firsthand is overwhelming in the best way. The concept of "konok" (guest) is sacred here. You're never just a visitor; you're a temporary family member. People insisted on feeding me until I could barely move, fixing my saddle when they noticed it was uncomfortable, offering their own warmer jackets when evening temperatures dropped.
- I participated in a traditional felt-making demonstration. Several women gathered to create shyrdak (colorful felt carpets), working together while singing folk songs. They laughed at my clumsy attempts but patiently showed me the techniques their mothers and grandmothers had taught them. The physicality of it ‚Äî rolling, beating, pressing the wool ‚Äî gave me enormous respect for the work behind every piece.

**The Lessons:**
Living among the Kyrgyz people, even briefly, shifted my perspective on what constitutes a good life. They have strong family bonds, deep connection to their land, and a pace of life that allows actual presence in each moment. One evening, watching the sun set while children played, horses grazed, and adults shared tea and conversation, I understood happiness in a way I'd intellectually known but never viscerally felt.

### üéí 5. The Unexpected Challenges

No adventure is complete without obstacles that test and teach you. SonQuli provided plenty of those moments.

**Physical Trials:**
- Altitude sickness hit me on day two. At over 3,000 meters, my body struggled to adjust. Headaches, nausea, dizziness. Nurlan made me slow down, drink more water, and chew raw garlic (a local remedy that actually helped). "The mountain tests everyone," he said. "Only the stubborn fail the test by ignoring their body."
- River crossings on horseback are terrifying the first time. Aizada stepped confidently into rushing glacial meltwater that came up to her chest. I had to trust she knew what she was doing while cold water soaked my boots and the current pulled at us.
- One afternoon, a sudden thunderstorm rolled in faster than we could reach shelter. Lightning cracked close enough to smell ozone. We dismounted, moved away from the horses, and hunkered down in a small depression. Thirty minutes of nature's raw power, rain so hard it stung, and my heart pounding with adrenaline. When it passed, the world smelled new and looked sharper.

**Emotional Journey:**
There were lonely moments. Times when the language barrier felt insurmountable. When I desperately wanted to share something but lacked the words. When I missed familiar comforts and questioned what I was doing so far from everything I knew.

But those difficult moments became transformative ones. In solitude and discomfort, I found unexpected strength. I learned to be present rather than constantly documenting. I put my camera away for an entire day and just existed in the experience. That day became the most vivid in my memory.

### üîÑ 6. The Return Journey and Farewell

Leaving SonQuli was harder than expected. Our three days together had passed in a blur of experiences, conversations, laughter, and genuine connection. On our last morning, Aizada nuzzled my shoulder as if she knew I was leaving. Nurlan gave me a small felt charm his grandmother had made. "For safe journeys," he said in Russian. "And to remember that these mountains are always here when you need them."

As we drove back toward Bishkek, Zamiraet was quieter than usual. Finally, he spoke in Russian: "You know, tomorrow I go back to being police chief. Paperwork, problems, politics. But these three days... I remember why I love my country. Why I work hard to protect it."

We stopped one final time at his home. His wife had prepared another feast ‚Äî she'd somehow known exactly when we'd arrive. The table was laden with all my favorite dishes from that first meal: plov with horse meat, potatoes, and endless cups of strong tea.

"You are always welcome in my home," Zamiraet said seriously over tea in Russian. "This is not polite words. This is real invitation. You come back to Kyrgyzstan, you come to my house first. My wife will be angry if you don't."

His wife, understanding the tone if not all my Russian words, nodded emphatically and pressed a package into my hands ‚Äî homemade sweets for my journey, wrapped carefully in cloth.

At the airport, Zamiraet refused to just drop me off. He parked and walked me all the way to security, carrying my bag despite my protests. "Police chief privilege," he grinned. "I can go anywhere."

At the security line, he pulled out his phone and took a photo of us together. "For my wife. She will want to see you one more time." Then he grew serious and gave me a firm hug ‚Äî not a handshake, a hug.

"You came to Kyrgyzstan as tourist," he said in Russian, which I now understood clearly. "You leave as friend. This is what I want for every visitor to my country. You tell people: Kyrgyz people are good people. We have beautiful land, yes, but more important ‚Äî we have big hearts."

He pressed something into my hand ‚Äî his personal phone number written on the back of his police chief business card. "You have any problem anywhere in Kyrgyzstan, you call this number. Even if I am in meeting with president, I answer."

I believed him completely.

**What Changed:**
I returned home a different person. Everything felt too fast, too loud, too disconnected. I caught myself seeking the silence and simplicity I'd found in the mountains just a week ago. Problems that had seemed enormous before my trip now felt manageable, even trivial.

But more than the landscape, it was the people who changed me ‚Äî especially Zamiraet. Here was a man with significant authority and responsibility who chose to spend three days sharing his country with a stranger. Not for money (he'd refused any payment beyond basic expenses), not for recognition, but simply because he believed in hospitality as a sacred duty.

I started questioning my relationship with possessions, with time, with people. The Kyrgyz taught me that wealth isn't measured in bank accounts but in relationships, experiences, and connection to something larger than yourself.

This trip happened just last week, and I'm still processing everything I experienced. The memories feel vivid and immediate ‚Äî the taste of horse meat plov, the roar of the waterfall, the warmth of the nomad family's yurt, Zamiraet's laugh, the trust in Aizada's steps. I know these experiences will stay with me for a lifetime.

### üí≠ Final Thoughts

SonQuli isn't just a place ‚Äî it's a full sensory adventure that engages every part of you. Mountains that humble you with their scale, horses that teach you partnership, lakes that reflect not just sky but your own soul, stars that remind you of your place in the universe, and people who show you humanity at its finest.

The landscapes are extraordinary, yes. But what truly makes SonQuli unforgettable is how it strips away pretense and reveals what really matters: connection, presence, courage, and the simple joy of being alive in a beautiful world.

I arrived seeking adventure. I left having found a piece of myself I didn't know was missing.

The mountains are still there, Nurlan still guides travelers, Aizada probably has new riders to teach, and the stars shine just as bright over SonQuli tonight as they did when I slept beneath them. Part of my heart remains there, in those high passes and wide valleys.

And that's exactly as it should be.

*Note: If you're considering a journey to Kyrgyzstan's mountains, go. Just go. Bring an open heart, sturdy boots, and willingness to be changed. The mountains will do the rest.*`,
