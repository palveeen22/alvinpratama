        title: 'Stop Using 100vh for Full-Height Layouts on Mobile: Here‚Äôs Why',
        content: `If you're using \`100vh\` for full-height layouts in your CSS, you might be unknowingly creating layout issues ‚Äî especially on mobile devices.

### üö´ The Problem:
\`100vh\` measures the viewport height *without accounting for dynamic browser UI elements*, such as the mobile address or navigation bars. This means your layout may look fine on desktop but:
- Content gets cut off on mobile
- Unwanted scrollbars appear
- Elements don't align correctly

### ‚úÖ The Modern Fix: \`100dvh\`
Instead of hardcoding \`height: 100vh;\`, use:

\`\`\`css
height: 100dvh;
\`\`\`

The new \`dvh\` unit (Dynamic Viewport Height) adapts to visible screen size, **even when browser UI changes** ‚Äî like when the address bar hides on scroll.

### üß† TL;DR
- **Before:** \`height: 100vh;\` ‚Üí breaks layouts on mobile
- **Now:** \`height: 100dvh;\` ‚Üí mobile-safe and reliable

It‚Äôs a tiny change with a big impact that saves hours of layout debugging.`,

        contentSort: `You might be unintentionally breaking your mobile layouts. Why? ‚ùå 100vh doesn't account for dynamic browser UI (like the address bar), especially on mobile.
